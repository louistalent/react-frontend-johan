If you make juice, beer, schnapps or wine yourself, you can give the bottles a nice look by adding your own labels on the bottles. The labels are made of a nice matte quality and they are water resistant, so you can store the bottles in the fridge. Best of all, you don't risk mixing them up if you make different batches.",
