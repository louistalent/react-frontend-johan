Self-adhesive labels and stickers are popular in many different situations e.g. on glasses, bottles. All our labels with pressure is that they are incredibly durable. They can withstand both sun, weather and wind and many can also withstand a trip in the dishwasher. If you make juice, beer, schnapps or wine yourself, you can give the bottles a nice look by adding your own labels on the bottles. The labels are made of a nice matte quality and they are water resistant, so you can store the bottles in the fridge. Best of all, you don't risk mixing them up if you make different batches.",
